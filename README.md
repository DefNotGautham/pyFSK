# pyFSK
This code is part of the assignment given for the course Digital Communication.
We use a standard binary data as an input signal, (randomly generated 16bit array in code).

The dependencies required for the compilation in python3 are:
1. Numpy 
2. Scipy
3. Matplotlib

These can be installed using the command line / Terminal commands as :
```
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install matplotlib
```
After installing the dependencies, you can download this repository and continue to execute FSK.py using python3.
